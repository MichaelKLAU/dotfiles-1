* Git 
1. [[http://dropshado.ws/post/7844857440/gitconfig-colors][David DeSandro]] blog entry is a good start point.
2. [[http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/git][Cheat sheets]] has more comprehensive entry.
* Vim
1. I use [[https://github.com/gmarik/vundle][Vundle]] to manage Vim packages.
2. [[https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner][vimoutliner/vimoutliner]] is the only complete repo of VimOutliner plugin. More details are in [[https://github.com/talha131/dotfiles/commit/42a19d07581087f274c3b461f6908ec5b75af6a7][this commit message]].
** Vim Markdown 
1. [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown][tpope/vim-markdown]] is mostly used. But it does not conceal text markers in Markdown file.
2. [[https://github.com/xolox/vim-markdown][xolox/vim-markdown]] does the concealing. See [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/pull/9#issuecomment-3098050][this image]] for example.
3. But you have to switch to xolox/vim-markdown =conceal= branch to get his code. Use =git checkout -b conceal remotes/origin/conceal= to checkout the branch.
